# eBook-database-project
- Good day, this is the second capstone project in the Stellenbosch University Software Engineering bootcamp course.
- It is a Python and SQL project. Through Python(SQLite3) I created a database called 'ebookstore' and inserted a table and some values(book records).
- The purpose was to create a database of ebooks for a bookstore and to provide a way to interact with the database.
- he Python program provides an interface to interact with the created database.
- Through the program you can add a book, update a book, delete a book, and search for a book.
